# MiTvStickUtils
This repository contains scripts for working with "4K Mi TV stick".


**deploy_as_system_apps.sh** - is a script that scans the directory in which it is located for the presence of applications and
loads these applications into the mi tv stick in the /system/app folder, without the subsequent ability to delete these applications.
